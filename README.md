## Ship Smart

Objective is to minimize the repeated entries and to automate the data entry in all the documents. 

The ShipSmart is built upon a centralized and optimised one stop, solution to cut down the overhead of handling multiple documents with static and common data across them. The feature will include an optimized API/solution to manage the static/repetitive data among various forms/documents by recognizing the form type and auto filling the data from a centralized database for a customer with the ability to edit/update values on the go. 

Later on, when we encounter variety in formats or language , we can include Google translator into the ML model to make the shipping documentation process more generalized and scalable. Also, when the documents are structured in a generalized way, we will get more and more data that will eventually lead on to better analysis and insight gains using AI and ML techniques.
